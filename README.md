# Student Club Menu Website

This repository contains a website for a student club that displays their menu and allows users to place orders. The website includes a menu with prices and descriptions, as well as a form for users to submit their orders.

## Getting Started

To view the website, simply clone or download the repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Features

- The website includes a menu with images, descriptions, and prices for the club's offerings.
- Users can select items from the menu and add them to their order.
- The website includes a form for users to submit their orders, including their name, contact information, and selected items.
- The website is responsive and will adjust to fit different screen sizes.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to add additional features to the website such as:

- The ability for the club to update and manage the menu items and prices.
- The ability for users to create accounts and save their order history.
- Integration with a payment system for users to pay for their orders online.
